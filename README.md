## Project Overview

This project analyzes daily pricing data for various US stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies to predict the next day's closing price for the S&P 500 index. The prediction model can be valuable for short-term trading strategies, portfolio rebalancing decisions, risk management systems, and market sentiment analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains daily pricing data from July 2022 to February 2024, including:

### Hyperparameter Optimization
- TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation (5 folds)
- Grid search for optimal configurations
- Strict temporal ordering to prevent lookahead bias

### Evaluation Framework
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R², and MAPE
- Training vs testing performance comparison
- Residual analysis to validate assumptions

This process identified the most effective forecasting approach while revealing predictive relationships in the financial time series.

### Data Leakage Considerations

Our project addressed two critical data leakage risks:

1. **Look-Ahead Bias**: Mitigated through chronological train-test split, lag features, and ensuring all technical indicators used only historical data
   
2. **Data Preprocessing Leakage**: Addressed by fitting transformations only on training data, performing feature selection using only training data, and using time-based cross-validation

## Regularized Linear Regression Models

To address overfitting observed in our previous models, we implemented two regularized linear regression approaches:

### Ridge Regression

Ridge regression adds an L2 penalty (sum of squared coefficients) to the linear regression cost function, helping to reduce the impact of multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Used `TimeSeriesSplit` with 5 folds for proper time series validation
- Tested alpha values ranging from 0.001 to 1000 (logspace) using grid search
- Selected optimal alpha value that minimized validation error

### Lasso Regression

Lasso regression adds an L1 penalty (sum of absolute coefficients) that can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Used `TimeSeriesSplit` with 5 folds for proper time series validation
- Tested alpha values ranging from 0.001 to 1000 (logspace) using grid search
- Selected optimal alpha value that minimized validation error
- Examined which features were retained by the model

### Optimal Hyperparameters

- **Ridge optimal alpha**: 10.0
- **Lasso optimal alpha**: 0.1

### Feature Selection Results with Lasso
![feature importance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f764f53-e19c-46a4-ac93-a8b7ac202826)
Feature Importance Results.*
The Lasso model with optimal alpha selected 35 features out of the original 87 engineered features. The most important retained features were:

1. Nasdaq_100_Price_lag_1
2. SNP500_lag_1
3. Microsoft_Price_lag_1
4. Apple_Price_lag_1
5. Gold_Price_lag_1

This significant reduction in features helps to prevent overfitting by creating a more parsimonious model.

| Ridge Regression | 21.95 | 42.18 | 0.996 | 0.912 | 0.58% | 0.98% |
| Lasso Regression | 22.31 | 43.45 | 0.996 | 0.905 | 0.59% | 1.01% |
| Random Forest | 10.33 | 67.08 | 0.999 | 0.869 | 0.28% | 1.51% |
| XGBoost | 0.02 | 66.49 | 1.000 | 0.869 | 0.00% | 1.48% |
| Tuned XGBoost | 1.72 | 66.35 | 1.000 | 0.843 | 0.05% | 1.46% |
| ARIMA | - | 261.18 | - | -0.717 | - | 5.75% |

### Key Observations

1. **Ridge Regression** emerged as the best-performing model with the lowest test MAE (42.18) and highest test R² (0.912)
2. **Lasso Regression** performed slightly worse than Ridge but better than the baseline Linear Regression

# Financial Time Series Forecasting Project

## Key Improvements

- **Reduced Test Error**: Ridge Regression's test MAE improved by 15.4% (from 49.83 to 42.18)
- **Narrower Performance Gap**: The difference between training and testing performance decreased by 27.9% for Ridge Regression
- **Model Simplification**: Lasso Regression reduced the feature set by 59.8%, creating a more parsimonious model
- **Better Generalization**: All models showed improved ability to generalize to unseen data
- **Reduced Variance**: Regularization techniques successfully reduced model variance without significantly increasing bias

These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to mitigating overfitting in financial time series forecasting.

## Overfitting Mitigation Strategies

### Regularization
- Ridge regression's L2 penalty helped control coefficient magnitudes
- Lasso regression's L1 penalty performed feature selection

### Time Series Cross-Validation
- Used TimeSeriesSplit instead of random k-fold cross-validation
- Respected temporal order of observations
- Prevented data leakage from future to past

### Feature Selection
- Lasso's built-in feature selection capability reduced model complexity
- Removed multicollinear features
- Selected features based on importance thresholds

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid search with time series cross-validation
- Systematically identified optimal regularization strength

### Ensemble Methods
- Created a simple ensemble by averaging predictions from multiple models
- Reduced variance in predictions

## Limitations

### Market Unpredictability
- Financial markets are influenced by unpredictable events
- Models cannot account for "black swan" events
- Market regime changes can render historical patterns less relevant

### Feature Limitations
- Our models rely primarily on price-based features
- Missing important factors:
  - Trading volume
  - Market sentiment
  - Macroeconomic indicators
  - Sector-specific developments

### Temporal Stability
- Model performance tends to degrade over time
- Periodic retraining is necessary but introduces complexity

### Overfitting Concerns
- Despite mitigation strategies, some models still show signs of overfitting
- Test performance remains significantly worse than training performance

### Prediction Horizon
- Current models focus on next-day predictions
- Longer-term forecasts would require different approaches

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of regularized linear regression models for predicting S&P 500 prices. Ridge Regression emerged as the optimal model, balancing complexity and performance with a test MAE of 42.18 (approximately 0.98% error rate).

For practical implementation, we recommend using the Ridge Regression model with daily retraining to maintain forecast accuracy.
