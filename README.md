  - Moving averages (7-day and 21-day)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Bollinger Bands
- **Date Features**: Day of week, month, and quarter
- **Interaction Terms**: Cross-features between highly correlated assets

## Model Development

- **Train/Test Split**: Time-based (not random) with first 80% for training, last 20% for testing
- **Models Evaluated**:
  - Linear Regression (baseline)
  - Ridge Regression (new)
  - Lasso Regression (new)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - ARIMA

### Data Leakage Considerations

Our project addressed two critical data leakage risks:

1. **Look-Ahead Bias**: Mitigated through chronological train-test split, lag features, and ensuring all technical indicators used only historical data
   
2. **Data Preprocessing Leakage**: Addressed by fitting transformations only on training data, performing feature selection using only training data, and using time-based cross-validation

## Regularized Linear Regression Models

To address overfitting observed in our previous models, we implemented two regularized linear regression approaches:

### Ridge Regression

Ridge regression adds an L2 penalty (sum of squared coefficients) to the linear regression cost function, helping to reduce the impact of multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Used `TimeSeriesSplit` with 5 folds for proper time series validation
- Tested alpha values ranging from 0.001 to 1000 (logspace) using grid search
- Selected optimal alpha value that minimized validation error

### Lasso Regression

Lasso regression adds an L1 penalty (sum of absolute coefficients) that can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Used `TimeSeriesSplit` with 5 folds for proper time series validation
- Tested alpha values ranging from 0.001 to 1000 (logspace) using grid search
- Selected optimal alpha value that minimized validation error
- Examined which features were retained by the model

### Optimal Hyperparameters

- **Ridge optimal alpha**: 10.0
- **Lasso optimal alpha**: 0.1

### Feature Selection Results with Lasso

The Lasso model with optimal alpha selected 35 features out of the original 87 engineered features. The most important retained features were:

1. Nasdaq_100_Price_lag_1
2. SNP500_lag_1
3. Microsoft_Price_lag_1
4. Apple_Price_lag_1
5. Gold_Price_lag_1

This significant reduction in features helps to prevent overfitting by creating a more parsimonious model.

## Performance Comparison

After implementing regularized linear models and additional overfitting mitigation techniques, here are the updated results:

| Model | Train MAE | Test MAE | Train R² | Test R² | Train MAPE | Test MAPE |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Linear Regression | 21.42 | 45.27 | 0.997 | 0.899 | 0.57% | 1.05% |
| Ridge Regression | 21.95 | 42.18 | 0.996 | 0.912 | 0.58% | 0.98% |
| Lasso Regression | 22.31 | 43.45 | 0.996 | 0.905 | 0.59% | 1.01% |
| Random Forest | 10.33 | 67.08 | 0.999 | 0.869 | 0.28% | 1.51% |
| XGBoost | 0.02 | 66.49 | 1.000 | 0.869 | 0.00% | 1.48% |
| Tuned XGBoost | 1.72 | 66.35 | 1.000 | 0.843 | 0.05% | 1.46% |
| ARIMA | - | 261.18 | - | -0.717 | - | 5.75% |

### Key Observations

1. **Ridge Regression** emerged as the best-performing model with the lowest test MAE (42.18) and highest test R² (0.912)
2. **Lasso Regression** performed slightly worse than Ridge but better than the baseline Linear Regression
3. **Regularized models** showed reduced gap between training and testing performance, indicating better generalization
4. **Tree-based models** still showed signs of overfitting despite tuning efforts
5. **ARIMA** continued to underperform compared to regression-based approaches

## Overfitting Mitigation Results

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our overfitting mitigation strategies, we've compared model performance before and after implementing these techniques.

### Performance Metrics Before and After Mitigation

| Model | Before Mitigation |  | After Mitigation |  |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| | **Test MAE** | **Train/Test Gap** | **Test MAE** | **Train/Test Gap** |
| Linear Regression | 45.27 | 23.85 | 45.27 | 23.85 |
| Ridge Regression | 49.83 | 28.06 | 42.18 | 20.23 |
| Lasso Regression | 51.47 | 29.52 | 43.45 | 21.14 |

These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to mitigating overfitting in financial time series forecasting.

## Overfitting Mitigation Strategies

### Regularization
- Ridge regression's L2 penalty helped control coefficient magnitudes
- Lasso regression's L1 penalty performed feature selection

### Time Series Cross-Validation
- Used TimeSeriesSplit instead of random k-fold cross-validation
- Respected temporal order of observations
- Prevented data leakage from future to past

### Feature Selection
- Lasso's built-in feature selection capability reduced model complexity
- Removed multicollinear features
- Selected features based on importance thresholds

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid search with time series cross-validation
- Systematically identified optimal regularization strength

- Reduced variance in predictions

## Limitations

### Market Unpredictability
- Financial markets are influenced by unpredictable events
- Models cannot account for "black swan" events
- Market regime changes can render historical patterns less relevant

### Feature Limitations
- Our models rely primarily on price-based features
- Missing important factors:
  - Trading volume
  - Market sentiment
